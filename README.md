# Insulin-Cost

This project is an attempt to examine the relationship between the rising cost of insulin and the effect of media representation/public awareness. Key findings include that (per publicly released Medicare Part D information) the price of insulin continues to rise proportionally to beneficiary increase, yet not according to dosage and claim increase; suggesting an artificial price hike disproportionate to supply and demand. This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook containing code documenting my entire process, from scraping and validating to my Linear Regression analysis and visualizations. A Powerpoint document outlining my process and key findings is also included, but lacks a full explanation, since this project was presented live.
